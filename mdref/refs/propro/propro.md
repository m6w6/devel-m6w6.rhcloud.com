# pecl/propro

## About:

The "Property Proxy" extension provides a fairly transparent proxy for internal object properties hidden in custom non-zval implementations.

> **Note:** This extension mostly only provides infrastructure for other extensions.

See the php\PropertyProxy class, for the user-land visible part of the implementation.

## Installation:

This extension is hosted at [PECL](http://pecl.php.net) and can be installed with [PEAR](http://pear.php.net)'s pecl command:

    # pecl install propro
