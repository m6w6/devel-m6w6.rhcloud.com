## About:

This is a modern binding to the mature [libpq](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html), the official PostgreSQL C-client library.

### Highlights:

* Nearly 100% support for [asynchronous usage](pq/AsyncOperations).
* Extended type [support by pg_type](pq/UsingTypes).
* Fetching simple [multi-dimensional array maps](pq/FetchingResults#markdown-header-fetching-simple-maps).
* Working [Gateway implementation](https://bitbucket.org/m6w6/pq-gateway).
